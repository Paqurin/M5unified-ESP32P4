## Feature Summary
Brief description of the ESP32-P4/Tab5 specific feature you'd like to see.

## Motivation
**Problem:** What ESP32-P4 or Tab5 specific problem does this solve?

**Use Case:** How would this feature benefit ESP32-P4 RISC-V development?

## Detailed Description
Comprehensive description of the proposed feature.

## ESP32-P4 Specific Benefits
- **RISC-V Architecture**: How does this leverage ESP32-P4's RISC-V capabilities?
- **32MB PSRAM**: Does this optimize PSRAM utilization?
- **Performance**: Expected performance improvements for ESP32-P4?
- **Hardware Integration**: How does this enhance Tab5 hardware support?

## Proposed Implementation
**API Design:**
```cpp
// Example API for the new feature
class ESP32P4NewFeature {
public:
    bool initialize();
    void process();
    // ESP32-P4 specific optimizations
};
```

**Hardware Requirements:**
- [ ] Tab5 specific pins: [list GPIO pins needed]
- [ ] I2C devices: [if applicable]
- [ ] SPI devices: [if applicable]
- [ ] Special peripherals: [USB OTG, camera, etc.]

## Compatibility Considerations
- **Platform**: ESP32-P4 exclusive or adaptable?
- **Memory**: PSRAM usage implications?
- **Power**: Impact on power management?
- **Performance**: CPU/memory overhead?

## Alternative Solutions
Have you considered other approaches? What are their limitations for ESP32-P4?

## Additional Context
**Related Libraries:**
- Similar implementations in other libraries?
- ESP-IDF components that could be leveraged?

**Hardware Testing:**
- [ ] I have access to M5Stack Tab5 for testing
- [ ] I can provide hardware testing
- [ ] I need hardware testing support

**Development Support:**
- [ ] I can contribute code
- [ ] I can provide testing
- [ ] I can write documentation
- [ ] I need development guidance

## Priority Level
- [ ] Critical (breaks existing ESP32-P4 functionality)
- [ ] High (significantly improves ESP32-P4 capabilities)
- [ ] Medium (nice to have for Tab5 development)
- [ ] Low (enhancement for future consideration)

## Example Use Case
```cpp
#include <M5Unified.h>

void setup() {
    auto cfg = M5.config();
    M5.begin(cfg);
    
    // Example of how the new feature would be used
    ESP32P4NewFeature feature;
    if (feature.initialize()) {
        M5.Display.println("New ESP32-P4 feature initialized!");
    }
}

void loop() {
    M5.update();
    // Feature usage in main loop
}
```
